## Framework and Libraries
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
We use Material design components from [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
We use [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing.
We use symantic-versioning for versioning.

## Angular Commit Message Conventions

This project uses Angular Commit Message Conventions for commit messages. This is to ensure that the commit messages are easy to read and follow a consistent format, and allow automatic versioning. The commit message should be structured as follows:

> <type>(<scope>): <subject>
> <BLANK LINE>
> <body>
> <BLANK LINE>
> <footer>

Type: This describes the kind of change that the commit makes. Common types include:
    feat: A new feature for the user, not a new feature for a build script.
    fix: A bug fix for the user, which can be a correction in the source code or associated documentation.
    docs: Documentation only changes.
    style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
    refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    perf: A code change that improves performance.
    test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
    chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.

Scope (optional): A scope provides additional contextual information. It could be anything specifying the location of the commit change (e.g., login, core, user-dashboard, etc.).

Subject: The subject contains a succinct description of the change:
    Use the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed" nor "changes".
    Don't capitalize the first letter.
    No dot (.) at the end.

Body (optional): The body should include a detailed description of the change:
    Use the imperative, present tense: "fix", not "fixed" nor "fixes".
    Should include motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

Footer (optional): The footer is used to reference issue tracker IDs, link pull requests, or provide notes that do not fit in the body:
    BREAKING CHANGE: A footer that starts with BREAKING CHANGE: followed by a description indicates a breaking change that suggests a major version bump if this is part of an automated versioning scheme.
